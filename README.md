# sunshine-mock.github.io

Sunshine mock is a Github Pages website built to mock the Overcast Network in order to test the [Sunshine Web API](https://github.com/SunshineAPI/WebAPI). Pages are scraped with [OvercastMock](https://github.com/SunshineAPI/OvercastMock) and included scripts.

The HTML content in this repository is neither owned nor license to the Sunshine API development team, and is only used for testing purposes.

## Usage
* All pages are updated by [OvercastMock](https://github.com/SunshineAPI/OvercastMock) and the included scripts. It may be manually run if there is a breaking change, or major update to Overcast or the Sunshine API.
* This repository may be forked and updated, but all pages must remain as they would if they were scraped by OvercastMock.
* Any accidental additions via OvercastMock must be manually removed, and can not be removed via the program.
* You should always pull the repository before making any commits because it is very important that the files remain as they would by default.
